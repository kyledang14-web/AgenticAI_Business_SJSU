Backend Implementation

The backend logic for this project was developed and tested in Google Colab and is included in this repository.

Backend Responsibilities

AI-driven request intake and intent classification

Agent-based reasoning and workflow orchestration

Knowledge retrieval using vector embeddings (RAG)

Automated resolution and escalation handling
